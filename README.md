# Animal Species Recognition Classification Project


An Animal Species Recognition and Classification project aims to create an artificial intelligence-based system that recognizes and classifies the images of various animal species using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

This project can be used as a potential tool, particularly in biological and environmental research, to detect and monitor the presence of animals in their natural habitats. Additionally, it can be useful for anyone who wants to learn more about animals.

The project starts with collecting images of many different animal species and identifying their characteristics. Then, a machine learning model is trained using this data, and afterwards, the system can identify and classify the species of an animal by taking an image of it.

This project is quite fascinating in terms of its application of machine learning and computer vision techniques. Additionally, it is quite useful for those who want to learn more about the animal species in our natural world.
